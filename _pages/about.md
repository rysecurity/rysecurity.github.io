Hi, I am seasoned penetration tester with a passion for securing web applications and Active Directory 
environments.I've dedicated my career to uncovering vulnerabilities and helping organizations fortify 
their defenses.

<font size="3"> <b>Why This Blog? </b> </font>

I started this blog to demystify the world of penetration testing and to provide actionable advice on both
 offensive and defensive security measures. My goal is to help readers understand the techniques used by 
 attackers and to offer guidance on how to mitigate risks effectively.
